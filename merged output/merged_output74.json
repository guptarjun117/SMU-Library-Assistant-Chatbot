I fail to download the Bloomberg data from the computer, and I went to the online Bloomberg service. It said that the terminal has reached the download limit for a month, and thus suggested I change one terminal. However, I have tried more than 3 terminals in the room and they all failed to download. I am having an important project right now, and I have turned to professor and he suggested I ask librarian. I am wondering whether I can download Bloomberg data through other ways? Could you please lift up the download limit of terminal? Or what else I can do to download the Bloomberg data?"
