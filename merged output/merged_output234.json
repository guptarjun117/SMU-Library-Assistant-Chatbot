I am looking for an economics book written by PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 and there are two versions. one is \"wealth of nations\", and the other is \"an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations\", which is much thicker. May I confirm that the only difference between the two is that the latter one contains many notes and explanations written by other economists?"
