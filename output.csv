3082372,15:51:43 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : Or just use the icon at the top of the Word document is the other way
3082372,15:52:05 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : Import the RIS file? Does that then include the actual article too ?
3082372,15:52:18 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : No. The RIS file does not include the actual article
3082372,15:52:27 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : just the reference record.

3082372,15:54:16 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : This means I need to save the RIS file first ?
3082372,15:54:18 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : Or double click on the RIS file.
3082372,"15:54:26 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : Yes, you would need to save it to your laptop."

3085236,14:09:15 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : anyway i took a look at the SCAQ syllabus handbook
3085236,"14:09:25 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : <a href=""https://www.sac.gov.sg/sites/sac2017/files/SCAQ%20Syllabus%20Handbook%20July%202022.pdf"" target=""_blank"">https://www.sac.gov.sg/sites/sac2017/files/SCAQ%20Syllabus%20Handbook%20July%202022.pdf</a>"

3085236,14:09:42 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : it doesn't look like they prescribe any particular texts
3085236,"14:10:07 - charvi : yess, I think they just have past practise papers or something to prepare"
3085236,"14:10:10 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : but i saw that it was topic based, so i think it is likely that we would have some secondary texts that are relevant on a topic basis"
3085236,"14:10:24 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : ah ok, i don't believe we have the past practice papers though"
3085236,14:10:43 - charvi : ohh alright!
3085236,14:11:03 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : because we mostly stock texts of an academic nature
3085236,14:11:14 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : but i guess if you are keen to see what texts we are
3085236,14:11:22 - charvi : ahh alright
3085236,14:11:26 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : you can reach out to the Accountancy Research Librarian
3085236,"14:11:44 - charvi : ok sureee, can you connect me to one? or do I email them?"
3085236,14:11:46 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : and he can do a quick run through of what we have that could be relevant to the SCAQ
3085236,"14:11:57 - charvi : ok sure, that would be great"

3086811,14:25:40 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : I have a question regarding citations
3086811,"14:27:04 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : For APA in-text citation, I understand that we need to include the author's last name. However the article only states the first letter of the author's last name (eg. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_6 D). Is it alright to include the first letter of the last name only in the in-text citation?"
3086811,"14:28:25 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : For this, i will have to refer it to my colleague. Could you wait for say another 5 mins, as my colleague is in a meeting now"

3087198,"12:30:09 - wan jun : hi, if i am citing from a website with an editor, last name PERSON_LASTNAME_4, that has his/her content cited from a author, how do i go bout my in-text citation?"

3087198,"12:35:36 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : The example goes:<br /><br /> PERSON_LASTNAME_1, 1982, as cited in Lyon, 2014)"
3087198,12:36:04 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : The good practice would be to locate the original source and use secondary citations sparingly
3087198,12:37:21 - wan jun : ok got it
3087198,12:37:25 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : Great : )
3087198,12:37:39 - wan jun : how do i also cite from government website?

3087198,"12:41:22 - wan jun : do i follow the parenthetical citation, instead of the narrative citation?"
3087198,12:42:27 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : Usually parenthetical
3087198,12:43:17 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : The narrative citation works like this:<br />Author (20XX) argues that his position is really good.
3087198,12:43:35 - wan jun : ohhh okay got it thank you!
3087198,12:43:43 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : yeaps~
3087198,12:43:47 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : Oh one more note
3087198,"12:45:02 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : When you're citing from the gov website, the version I passed to you works for government websites with the agency as the author.<br /><br />In other words, if there is an author, eg. NCSS, written by PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2, that would be a slightly different style."
3087198,"12:46:12 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : For now, I think we have got your queries covered though.<br />"
3087198,12:47:46 - wan jun : yep! okay thank you!
3087198,"12:48:48 - wan jun : oh sorry, one more question"
3087198,12:48:59 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : No problem
3087198,"12:49:01 - wan jun : when i cite from sources, do i have to paraphrase them?"
3087198,"12:49:15 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : Personally, I would do that"
3087198,12:49:37 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : One reason you would want to do that so you will not be accused of plagiarism

3087969,"16:57:54 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : yes, i have looked through it but it does not answer my questions"
3087969,16:58:09 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : my question relates to publishing for research staff
3087969,"16:58:10 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : some journals ask for the copyright for a paper to be published. since i am research staff, i don't think i hold the copyright to what i produce as part of my employment, even though my job scope explicitly says that i must publish papers in journals"
3087969,"16:58:53 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : in my field, journals require the author to sign a publication agreement which may include a transfer of copyright unless a special agreement is made"
3087969,"16:59:12 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : my question is, what is the procedure for research staff with regards to these"
3087969,16:59:19 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : you do own copyright of your own paper.
3087969,16:59:30 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : let me see what information I can find.
3087969,17:00:31 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : okay. my reading of the IP policy says that faculty retain their copyright. students also retain their copyright if it is not made in the course of their employment
3087969,"17:01:14 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : research staff, however, do not seem to have the same exception as faculty"
3087969,17:01:24 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : I think researchers do holed the rights as faculty.
3087969,17:02:08 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : I can pass your question to my colleague who is an expert in research and publshing.
3087969,17:02:14 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : yes please
3087969,"17:04:00 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : just for your information also, when my colleague asked OLGA, she was told that research staff are covered by the IP policy, which I assume means that we do not hold the copyright"
3087969,17:04:36 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : i just send your question to my colleague. she will come back to you via email for clairificaiton.
3087969,17:04:45 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : okay.

3091834,"17:49:37 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : Hi PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2, quick question on usage of the library's resources (images in particular) - the resources and images copyright free and available for non-commercial use for students and public?"
3091834,17:49:39 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : thanks!
3091834,17:50:17 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : as in the images that you get from e.g. the databases?
3091834,17:50:37 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : or do you mean like images of the library?
3091834,"17:51:19 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : if you are talking about information from the databases, these resources are only available to enrolled students, and not the general public"
3091834,17:52:25 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : the specific conditions which restrict the use of information may vary from database to database. but the general theme is that it should only be used for academia purposes.
3091834,17:52:34 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : otherwise copyright would apply

3093205,18:29:40 - [name1] : do you have some other questions?
3093205,"18:29:59 - [name2] : so, if i were to type PERSON_LASTNAME_2 (2011), a professor at ... said that..."""
3093205,18:30:02 - [name2] : would it be correct?
3093205,18:30:10 - [name2] : or should the date not be there first?
3093205,18:30:26 - [name1] : the formatting is correct
3093205,18:30:54 - [name2] : okay. im confused because in this instance im referring to him as a person rather than what he said.
3093205,"18:30:55 - [name1] : it's usually [some argument] PERSON_LASTNAME_2, 2011). Or According to PERSON_LASTNAME_2 (2011), [your argument]"
3093205,18:31:28 - [name2] : okayyy
3093205,18:31:30 - [name2] : thank you

3093205,18:33:03 - [name1] : so I guess should be fine..
3093205,"18:33:15 - [name2] : okay, thank you so much"
3093205,18:33:25 - [name2] : i might find a better way to rephrase it~
3093205,18:33:44 - [name1] : ya I would suggest to do that as well
3093205,"18:33:57 - [name2] : maybe ""with ten years of experience in the field, feredick (2011) said that..."
3093205,18:34:00 - [name1] : are you doing the comparative article for WR?
3093205,18:34:05 - [name2] : yes
3093205,18:34:36 - [name1] : is this one of the articles?
3093205,"18:35:20 - [name1] : If you want to make a point about this article is more reliable/trustworthy because the author is an expert in the field, you can also discuss that in a separate sentence"
3093205,18:35:53 - [name1] : to elaborate the point instead of weaving it into another point that you're trying to make
3093205,18:36:39 - [name1] : the other option you suggested looks ok too
3093205,"18:36:44 - [name2] : ohh, i get your point. but he is not one of the authors. i am just using his textbook to prove my point that ___ makes a good introduction"
3093205,18:36:53 - [name1] : ohh okay
3093205,18:36:59 - [name2] : thank you so much though

3093727,"11:08:27 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : Hi PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5, how can we help you today"
3093727,11:10:24 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : Hi PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3. I am currently trying to figure out how to navigate SMU database SCOPUS to find out the number of articles published in a particular journal. May I know if this is the appropriate/correct tool to use ?
3093727,11:11:22 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : it would depend on whether the SCOPUS coverage of that journal is complete. Do you happen to have the title of the journal?
3093727,11:12:10 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : Yes i do
3093727,"11:12:23 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : great, could i trouble you for it?"
3093727,11:12:34 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : Journal of Organizational Behavior
3093727,11:13:03 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : thanks. let me just check
3093727,"11:13:43 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : just to confirm, is it this journal?"
3093727,"11:13:44 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10991379"" target=""_blank"">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10991379</a>"
3093727,11:14:27 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : yes. it's something like that
3093727,"11:14:53 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : sorry, as in is this the journal you want to check?"
3093727,11:15:02 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : yes
3093727,"11:15:58 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : based on this journal, i would like to find out how many articles were published by a particular faculty member from year 2020 to 2022. Is is possible to find out using SCOPUS ?"
3093727,11:16:28 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : ah yeah that would be possible
3093727,11:16:34 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : you can either look under this page
3093727,"11:16:35 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : <a href=""https://www-scopus-com.libproxy.smu.edu.sg/sourceid/30020#tabs=2"" target=""_blank"">https://www-scopus-com.libproxy.smu.edu.sg/sourceid/30020#tabs=2</a>"
3093727,11:17:11 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : so you can filter using the faculty's name within each year
3093727,"11:17:29 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : the other way which is probably faster, is to search via author using the faculty's name"
3093727,11:17:53 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : then to filter by publications under this journal
3093727,11:18:06 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : and then further filter within 2020 to 2022
3093727,"11:19:18 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : Attached a file: <a href=""https://libfaq.smu.edu.sg/chat_file.php?i=28&amp;f=106470&amp;preview=true"" class=""s-la-cfile"" data-preview=""inline"" target=""_blank"">https://libfaq.smu.edu.sg/chat_file.php?i=28&amp;f=106470&amp;preview=true</a>"
3093727,"11:19:37 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : in the screenshot, there is an option to search by author"
3093727,"11:22:30 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : i noticed that if i typed in the full name of the faculty member, the database won't be able to retrieve the results"
3093727,"11:23:24 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : it would turn on the way the faculty registered his name on Scopus, or how Scopus pulled the indexed information"
3093727,11:23:30 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : do you have his ORCID ID?
3093727,11:23:42 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : that might be the best way to identify the faculty
3093727,11:23:42 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : what is ORCID ID ?
3093727,11:23:53 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : my apologies. i recently joined SMU
3093727,11:23:59 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : no worries!
3093727,11:24:10 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : its just a unique identifier for authors
3093727,11:24:18 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : kinda like a NRIC
3093727,11:24:28 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : i have his name
3093727,11:24:42 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : Do you need this for a school thing?
3093727,11:25:00 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : yes
3093727,"11:25:23 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : you can write to Ms PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_4. She is the head of Research Data services, and can help you to pull out the stats"
3093727,"11:25:36 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : that might be better, since she can verify the publications too"
3093727,11:25:40 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : do you have her email address ?
3093727,11:26:01 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : ppyeo@smu.edu.sg
3093727,11:26:03 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : here you go
3093727,"11:26:21 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : sorry, just to check, you are from LKCSB?"
3093727,11:26:26 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : school of business?
3093727,11:27:01 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : yes
3093727,"11:27:03 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : Could i trouble you to also copy the Research Librarian, who is coordinator for LKCSB as well? PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4, her email address issumitag@smu.edu.sg"
3093727,11:27:05 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : thanks!
3093727,11:27:06 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : i am from LKCSB
3093727,11:27:21 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : PERSON_LASTNAME_4 will be able to provide the data
3093727,11:27:34 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : grateful if you could let her know which prof it is
3093727,11:27:38 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : and which journal
3093727,11:27:39 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : thank you!
3093727,11:27:42 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : ok sure

3093727,11:27:50 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : no worries!
3093727,11:28:03 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : is there anything else i can assist you with?
3093727,11:28:22 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : i think that will do
3093727,11:28:34 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : ok thanks
3093727,11:28:37 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : can i check with you
3093727,11:28:37 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : i will end the chat then
3093727,11:28:41 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : oh sure
3093727,11:28:42 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : whats up
3093727,11:28:56 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : is sumita one of your colleagues from library ?
3093727,11:29:21 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : both PERSON_LASTNAME_4 and PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 are my colleagues from the Library
3093727,11:29:26 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : oh ok
3093727,"11:30:08 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : PERSON_LASTNAME_4 is in charge of bibliometrics, like the publication stats. PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 is the coordinator for school of business, so like the main liason person for LKCSB"
3093727,"11:30:52 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : there are two other Research Librarians for business too, but in this case, i am not sure who your prof is, and so just probably easier to copy PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4, to keep her in the loop"
3093727,11:31:06 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : oh ok. thanks for the clarification.
3093727,11:31:11 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : since the different business librarians manage different faculty
3093727,11:31:14 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : no problem
3093727,11:31:21 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : you can end the chat

3097289,"17:20:40 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : This is because for both New York Times and Straits Times, they have a print edition so they are considered newspapers"
3097289,"17:21:01 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : Hence for both titles, you need to italicise them in the reference list"
3097289,"17:22:27 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_4 : For CNA, it will be the site name CNA has to be italicised?"
3097289,"17:23:02 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : No, for CNA, its is the article title that should be in italics because CNA is a news website"
3097289,"17:23:52 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_4 : Noted, thank you for the clarification. Have a good day ahead :)"
3097289,17:24:04 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : No worries.

3097295,"17:13:44 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : Hi, I am currently trying to access statista and I am receiving this error"
3097295,"17:13:48 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : We are sorry, unfortunately your access has been suspended, this may be due to unintentional excessive data usage."
3097295,17:13:56 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : ok.. let me check<br />
3097295,"17:14:31 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : I think this is a repeat issue, would you also happen to know the reason why?"
3097295,17:15:10 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : have you tried to access the databases from anywhere?<br />
3097295,"17:17:08 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : yes, at my workplace and home"
3097295,17:18:42 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : ok.. it may be because you are using this from your company's network... thus it triggers the block.. becos of the IP issue<br />
3097295,"17:19:46 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : I see, is there a workaround for this or do I just avoid using the databases at work?"
3097295,17:20:20 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : technically you should be avoiding the usage at work.. because the resources are not meant for internship purposes...<br />
3097295,17:21:09 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : it has implications if the IP gets tracked... we will have to investigate and probably flagged users up as a breech... <br />
3097295,17:21:40 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : because from the platform perspective.. companies are supposed to pay for their own subscription... so by leveraging on interns (Students) access.. it is a breech<br />
3097295,"17:22:46 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : ahh i see, i was using the databases for a case competition but using the company wifi"
3097295,"17:22:56 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : alright noted, ill avoid using it at work from now"
3097295,17:23:15 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : well.. just refrain if possible... <br />
3097295,17:23:41 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : the account has been unblocked..<br />
3097295,17:23:49 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : so you should be able to access again<br />
3097295,17:24:00 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : alright thanks alot for the help!

3097796,11:57:25 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : Hi PERSON_LASTNAME_1 Jun!
3097796,11:57:28 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : This is PERSON_LASTNAME_4 from SMU Libraries. How may I help you?
3097796,"11:58:22 - wan jun : hi, i want to cite a statement from an article, but the statement is a bit too long, so is it possible to cite with ""abc,...,xyz""?"
3097796,11:58:29 - wan jun : apa-7
3097796,"11:59:45 - wan jun : for reference, this is the statement: Not to mention, the understanding that an individual with a billion dollars in accumulated wealth, assets and investments actively chooses not to ease the suffering of millions, even billions worldwide, instead hoarding a fortune that is too much for one person to reasonably spend."
3097796,"12:00:16 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : Yes, you can. I think another, maybe better, way might be citing it as seperate, shorter statements."
3097796,"12:01:16 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : For example: The Author (Year, para./p. X) argued that ""abc"" and ""xyz""."
3097796,12:01:51 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : Suject to how you want to organise your texts.
3097796,12:02:21 - wan jun : ohhh okay
3097796,"12:03:55 - wan jun : i'm doing this for a2, so the comparative analysis is based on both articles. "
3097796,"12:05:59 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : I see. Yes, generally WR instructors don't require students to repeat the in-text citations for the two articles in their essays. But when you use quotation citations, you'd still need to indicate the exact locations of the quotes by writing down the page or paragraph numbers."
3097796,"12:06:32 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : For example: ""Author"" argued that ""abc"" (para. X) and ""xyz"" (para. Y)."
3097796,"12:07:04 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : When both fall within the same paragraph, you can put it as: ""Author"" argued that ""abc"" and ""xyz"" (para. X)."

3098005,15:44:41 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : Hi PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_3
3098005,15:44:43 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : how may I help you?
3098005,"15:44:58 - LIU QUAN : Hi PERSON_LASTNAME_4, good afternoon!"
3098005,"15:46:40 - LIU QUAN : I am writing a policy proposal for MOE in china (only writing assessment will not submit to MOE lah), but it is hard to collect sound evidence to support my arguement. May I ask help for that? thank you T-T"
3098005,"15:49:03 - LIU QUAN : For example, ""only 30% of university students take jobs relevant to their bachelor's degrees within three years after graduation"" I can searched and obtained this information on website like Quora (without reliable source), I tried to find some essays or database but failed."
3098005,15:49:05 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : Could you share more about your research and what kind of help you are seeking on?
3098005,15:51:32 - LIU QUAN : I got idea to write the sentence above because I saw a similar research conducted in another country. but the data I can find is limited
3098005,15:53:32 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : hmmm ok can give it a try... but usually starting with a (unreliable) argument and trying to look for evidence is harder.
3098005,15:53:55 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : I might be a bit slow in replying you as I am having multiple chats. Please give me some time to get back to you.
3098005,15:55:55 - LIU QUAN : No problem no hurry! I think the example above is the major challenge for now as I generate many ideas from that point. For other evidence I can alter the argument a bit I think......
3098005,15:56:21 - LIU QUAN : Yes it is hard T-T generally I should read more before I write////
3098005,15:57:06 - LIU QUAN : Thank you!
3098005,15:57:09 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : so the information you're looking for is about whether university graduates are able to find jobs relevant to their degrees?
3098005,15:57:36 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : or data related to unemployment rate will also be useful?
3098005,"15:59:41 - LIU QUAN : Yes, the concern is that many university students today did not consider carefully to choose the major, so that it is hard to apply their knowledge in future career"
3098005,16:00:29 - LIU QUAN : probably yes o.o
3098005,"16:02:40 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : I will take some time to work on this, and will get back to you via email ok?"
3098005,"16:02:58 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : also btw, have you tried Chinese sources? That could be another option as well"
3098005,"16:03:21 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : try if can find official statistics released by the government, i.e. primary sources"
3098005,16:08:36 - LIU QUAN : Sorry I was browsing other pages just now so that reply late. It is totally ok! Thanks for your support T-T
3098005,"16:11:45 - LIU QUAN : The Chinese sources (official statistics) is more about general topics and not that specific, I did not find the evidence there for now but I will continue to try! (I am kind of not good at researching......)"
3098005,"16:21:19 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : yeah because your question is very specific, unlikely to be found in official released data"
3098005,16:21:25 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : i think might be better to search in chinese
3098005,16:21:37 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : try keyword such as
3098005,"16:21:52 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : <a href=""https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20210624A02AI800"">2021_ (qq.com)</a>"

3098005,"16:26:24 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : <p>this is research in 2010.. try to look for similar surveys conducted in more recent years, where possible 2010200967%57%</p><br />"
3098005,"16:26:42 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : also try to make sure the source is reliable, this one seems ok (from edu.cn)"
3098005,16:27:17 - LIU QUAN : That's helpful!! thank you so much
3098005,"16:27:58 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : no problem! just try different keywords and sources. Sometimes the articles will also mention the source of their data, then you can dig deeper on those reports as well"
3098005,16:28:27 - LIU QUAN : PERSON_LASTNAME_5 I did not come up with the correct keyword and search like blindly......
3098005,16:28:33 - LIU QUAN : Oki! Thank you
3098005,16:28:50 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : no problem! let us know if you need further help
3098005,16:29:06 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : we can refer you to a business librarian for a research consultation as well
3098005,"16:29:44 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : as you are search for sources, take note of the keywords they use. That is a strategy to help you expand and use relevant keywords"
3098005,"16:33:04 - LIU QUAN : One more question! if it is not bothering could you help me verify a bit about the credibility of ranking from this website? <a href=""https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/education-rankings-by-country;"" target=""_blank"">https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/education-rankings-by-country;</a> I think it is not a fake website but I am not sure if it can be used for academic purpose. I also find another ranking from QS (which is more famous) but I do not really believe that from my personal perspective......"
3098005,16:33:17 - LIU QUAN : Oki :-D
3098005,"16:34:56 - LIU QUAN : <a href=""https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/education-rankings-by-country"" target=""_blank"">https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/education-rankings-by-country</a>"

3098005,16:36:20 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : I think you can use this source
3098005,"16:36:27 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : like you said, it's not illegitimate"
3098005,16:36:39 - LIU QUAN : Oki! that's great
3098005,16:36:39 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : but note that it is a commercial organization
3098005,16:37:09 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : and whether or not their ranking is accurate or reputable/influential is another question
3098005,16:37:40 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : QS rankings is more established and well known
3098005,16:38:29 - LIU QUAN : T-T yea I think it is more like a summary from other sources rather than conducting researches and having reliable index to refer
3098005,16:38:56 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : just need to exercise good judgement on which source you would like to use

3098005,"16:41:07 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : hmmm i can't comment on that lol. There will be some underlying methodlogies and justifications for their rankings, but those can of course be challenged"
3098005,16:41:35 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : but I would say that research is not about personal opinions
3098005,16:42:23 - LIU QUAN : oki! thank you :-D your support is truly helpful

3100039,16:26:40 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : Hi - I am one of the adjunct tutors for COMM1304. A course reading is Chapter 8 (about 28 pages) of Essentials of Business Communication by PERSON_LASTNAME_4 and PERSON_LASTNAME_3. The library only has a hard copy of the 2008 edition
3100039,16:28:04 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : I need the text over the weekend to prep for my class (only just realised I do not have access to the ebook). I contacted Cengage and they have an eBook copy which I can purchase (2016 version). I was asked if I am using it for teaching.
3100039,"16:28:44 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : My question is - if I say that I am using it for teaching, will there be any cost to SMU for keeping it as part of the course reading?"
3100039,16:29:21 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : The person asked me to write to the sales person who may be able to provide a complimentary copy if I am using it to teach.
3100039,16:29:30 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : Grateful if you could advise
3100039,"16:32:57 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : Hi PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2, there shouldn't be any cost to us regardless of how you are using the book. Usually the publishers are happy to provide instructors with the complimentary copy, because if you end up adopting it, they can sell more to the library and students. So it is fine to say that you intend to use it for teaching. On our library's end, we can purchase copies if your students require it, and that should be the only cost to us."
3100039,16:33:03 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : Hope I managed to answer your question!
3100039,"16:33:49 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : Yes, thank you PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1. I'll write to Cengage to request for a copy."

3109736,16:38:34 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : how may I help you?
3109736,16:39:19 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : hi i am looking for assistance to access the ceic database
3109736,16:39:52 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : are you encountering some issue?
3109736,16:40:30 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : yeap i cant seem to login with my school email and password. am i supposed to create an account ?
3109736,"16:42:11 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : you do not have to create an account. If you are on the home page, look for the green block that says 'Guest Access'"
3109736,16:42:24 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : click on
3109736,"16:43:48 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : If you want to use some features that's available only to logged in users, feel free to register for an account. It is a separate registration with CEIC and not the same as your school email/pw"
3109736,16:44:11 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : i can register with my personal email ?
3109736,"16:45:03 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : hmmm I'm not sure, you can give it a try. But generally we encourage you to use smu email"
3109736,16:45:22 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : okay thanks
3109736,16:45:45 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : it might work for CEIC since you are accessing using librayr proxy anyway. Some databases requires the @smu.edu.sg domain in your email
3109736,"16:45:54 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : if your personal email doesn't work, try switching to smu email"
3109736,16:46:19 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : okay sure thanks
3109736,16:46:21 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : also where am i able to find scientific data on negotiation techniques
3109736,16:46:45 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : what kind of scientific data are you looking for? can you elaborate a bit more?
3109736,16:47:17 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : for eg scientific evidence that shows that integrative distribution as a form of negotiation garners more/less success in negotiations
3109736,16:47:37 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : something that has charts or numbers
3109736,16:49:28 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : hmmm I suppose you want to look for academic research articles that for example have conducted some experiements to show the effectiveness of this negotiation technique?
3109736,16:50:21 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : yeap
3109736,16:50:44 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : which database would be the most useful for it?
3109736,"16:51:34 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : for journal articles, an easy starting point is library.smu.edu.sg (the search box) or Google Scholar"
3109736,"16:51:35 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/"" target=""_blank"">https://scholar.google.com/</a>"
3109736,16:51:54 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : it depends on the depth that you are looking into as well
3109736,"16:52:05 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : try Review papers, such as this one"
3109736,16:53:27 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/334950975.pdf
3109736,16:54:47 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : a very interesting tool that you can consider trying is Elicit.org
3109736,"16:56:32 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : it is an academic research tool that can try to give you answers to questions in natural language. It sometimes gives interesting papers. When you have the paper title, you can try search in library to gain access"

3110425,14:49:49 - lydia : for uk bond market overview research

3110425,"14:58:50 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : Could you email me the specifics/details? It may not be that straightforward. It depends on what data item you are looking at. I would suggest you give Bloomberg another try as well. Also, the Eikon terminal."

3129726,12:49:37 - [name1] : HiValliappan
3129726,12:49:42 - [name1] : how may I help you?
3129726,"12:50:00 - Valliappan : Hi, I am a Year 4 SOA student. I am searching for an academic article for goodwill and IFRS accounting"
3129726,12:50:46 - Valliappan : I am confused as to what is practitioner and what is an academic article
3129726,"12:51:56 - [name1] : Sure, what I can do is to help you identify what an academic article looks like. Before that may I find out further why you need to differentiate btw a practitioner and academic article"
3129726,"12:53:54 - Valliappan : My team needs to find 1 practitioner and 1 academic article each. We have already found the practitioner one. Hence, We need to find an academic research article to summarise and write for our report."
3129726,12:53:54 - [name1] : Here are some general differences btw some practitioner and academic article just FYI
3129726,"12:53:57 - [name1] : <p>In accounting, practitioner articles are typically written by professionals working in the field, such as practicing accountants or financial advisors, and are often focused on practical issues or solutions related to accounting and finance. These articles may provide practical advice, case studies, or real-world examples of how accounting principles are applied in practice.</p><p>Academic articles, on the other hand, are written by scholars or researchers and are often focused on theoretical or conceptual issues related to accounting and finance. These articles may include empirical studies, theoretical frameworks, or conceptual models that help to advance our understanding of accounting concepts and practices.</p><p>Some key differences between practitioner and academic articles in accounting may include:</p><ul><li>Focus: Practitioner articles are typically focused on practical issues or solutions related to accounting and finance, while academic articles may be more theoretical or conceptual in nature.</li><li>Tone: Practitioner articles may be written in a more informal or accessible style, while academic articles may be more technical or specialized.</li><li>Sources: Practitioner articles may draw on practical experience or case studies, while academic articles may rely more heavily on empirical research or theoretical frameworks.</li><li>Audience: Practitioner articles are typically written for a professional audience, such as practicing accountants or financial advisors, while academic articles are aimed at an academic audience, such as researchers or scholars in the field of accounting.</li></ul><br />"
3129726,12:54:07 - [name1] : ohh I see
3129726,"12:54:59 - [name1] : let me find some examples. Usually an academic article is published in something called academic journals, e.g. Journal of Accounting Research<a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1475679X"" target=""_blank"">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1475679X</a>"
3129726,"12:55:49 - [name1] : articles in this journal are all academic articles. They often have a journal name, volume, issue and page number, and a lot of times a DOI"

3130990,16:03:50 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : I think your appendix title should describe it as an enlarged image of figure 3
3130990,16:04:03 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : instead of relabelling it figure 3 in the appendix
3130990,16:04:08 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : since that would be inaccurate
3130990,16:04:16 - PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : ! Thank you

3131029,"18:02:03 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : <a href=""https://www.apa.org/monitor/dec06/healthday#:~:text=The%20World%20Health%20Organization%20estimates,often%20depression%20or%20substance%20abuse"" target=""_blank"">https://www.apa.org/monitor/dec06/healthday#:~:text=The%20World%20Health%20Organization%20estimates,often%20depression%20or%20substance%20abuse</a>."
3131029,18:02:16 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : in this article there is this phrase
3131029,18:02:18 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : Mental illness is a major risk factor for suicide. The World Health Organization estimates that 90 percent of all suicide victims have some kind of mental health condition--often depression or substance abuse.
3131029,18:02:44 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : this webpage is by american psychologival association
3131029,18:02:58 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : but they claimed WHO said 90% of suicides are ...
3131029,18:03:37 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : so do i attribute it to WHO or American Psychological Association?
3131029,18:03:53 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : based on APA citations
3131029,18:04:20 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_4 : are you referencing the report?
3131029,"18:04:50 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_4 : as the basis for this ""WHO said 90% of suicides are..."""
3131029,"18:05:32 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : i think im referencing American Psychological Association webpage becuase i pulled the phrase ""The World Health Organization estimates that 90 percent of all suicide victims have some kind of mental health condition"" out of their webpage"
3131029,"18:06:41 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_4 : yup, strictly speaking you are referring the APA article on their webpage"
3131029,18:06:55 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_4 : so you should cite the webpage and not the WHO
3131029,"18:07:19 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_4 : but in your sentence, it would obviously refer to the WHO making the estimate"
3131029,18:07:43 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_4 : as in your sentence should read that it is the WHO that makes the estimate
3131029,"18:08:11 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : okay! so when i do intext, ill just say smth like"
3131029,18:08:37 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_4 : yup but there is a date

3131029,18:08:58 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : can I skip the WHO said and simply say:
3131029,18:09:45 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_4 : i think better to retain WHO
3131029,18:09:54 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : since it is declared by them
3131029,18:09:55 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : okay
3131029,18:09:57 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_4 : since that is the basis of the page's assertion

3131652,"14:03:34 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : This is the passage that I'd like to cite, According to PERSON_LASTNAME_4 (2013), stress is defined as a ""state of disharmony in the bodys homeostasis when a real or perceived threat is encountered""."
3131652,14:03:47 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : Would this be the correct way?
3131652,14:04:08 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : As I am taking a direct definition..
3131652,14:04:17 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : PERSON_LASTNAME_4 (2013) is where you got the definition from stress from yeah?
3131652,14:04:57 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : yes
3131652,14:05:30 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : You would need to include the page number or paragraph number for those without page number
3131652,"14:05:51 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : As Crane (2017) said,""Mindfulness has become a trend word conveying a diversity of understandings dependent on context"" (p. 586)."
3131652,"14:06:21 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : If no page number, you can use paragraph number -(para.8)"
3131652,"14:08:33 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : so if its paragraph it would be, According to PERSON_LASTNAME_4 (2013), stress is defined as a ""state of disharmony in the bodys homeostasis when a real or perceived threat is encountered"" (para.2)."
3131652,14:09:06 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : do I also include the dash (-)?
3131652,14:09:14 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : No need dash
3131652,14:09:15 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : haha.
3131652,14:09:34 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : Alright then! Thank you so much~
3131652,14:09:41 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : No problem. :D
3131652,14:09:54 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : The intext citation was almost there
3131652,14:10:04 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : just missing the para number which you have added.
3131652,14:11:23 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : Alright~
3131652,14:11:50 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : Is there anything else I can assist you with?
3131652,"14:14:04 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : Yes, I'm also citing another definition, but it is from a website that has no paragraph or page number"
3131652,14:14:08 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : it looks like this..
3131652,"14:15:21 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : attached a file: <a href=""https://libfaq.smu.edu.sg/chat_file.php?i=28&amp;f=108469&amp;preview=true"" target=""_blank"" class=""s-la-cfile"" data-preview=""inline"">https://libfaq.smu.edu.sg/chat_file.php?i=28&amp;f=108469&amp;preview=true</a>"

3131652,14:16:55 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : Hmm let me take a look.
3131652,14:16:57 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : Hang on
3131652,14:18:45 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : Ok
3131652,"14:19:17 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : Generally for website, if there is no paragraph number, we can use section and header"
3131652,"14:19:27 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : however, in this case, it seems more like a search result"
3131652,14:20:55 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : yeahh..
3131652,14:21:10 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : So this is a little out of the normal. haha.
3131652,14:21:55 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : I am considering using either the NCI search results as the section header. But let me discuss this with my colleague first so that we can provide the more appropriate suggestion.
3131652,14:22:08 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : So if you could hang on a moment.
3131652,"14:25:52 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : Hi PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1, may I get back to you via email? Let me check with the APA citation book."
3131652,"14:26:36 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 : Sure no problem, in that case I'll wait for your response through my email!"

3133828,"17:29:00 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 : I also see that you're currently a Year One student. If you'd wish to use the inter-library loan services, you will need to get in touch with your Research Librarian to get approval."

3139746,10:11:22 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : It seems to be a data max out issue or too many rows

3139746,10:11:33 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : what is the limit
3139746,10:11:49 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : but the search result is less than 1000 items

3139746,"10:14:47 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : As your search result is less than 1000 items, we think that it may be a case of reaching the data limit for that terminal."

3139746,10:15:10 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : He is on-site today

3154341,"12:37:54 - PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : Nope, nothing else :) Thanks a bunch PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2, have a good day"
3154393,"13:20:44 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_7 : Hi PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5, good day to you. Thank you for contacting SMU Libraries. My name is PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3. How may I help you today?"
3154393,13:21:37 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Hi PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3. I was hoping to get some advice on data analysis. I remember that previously I attended a data analysis course through the SMU library.
3154393,"13:22:56 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Using STATA. So basically, I'm trying to predict if an individual will earn &gt;50K. Since it's binary, I'm using a logit model, and the independent variables are things like age, workclass, occupation, country, etc."
3154393,"13:24:24 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : For workclass, occupation, country, there are 966, 963 and 273 missing variables respectively. I tried to create a new variable to indicate missing values. It'll indicate 1 if missing values, and 0 otherwise. But STATA keeps ommitting the 0.missing_values because of collinearity."
3154393,"13:25:08 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : I was hoping to speak to the data libririan to get some advice on my problem. I've checked the internet, and the advice online seems contradictory."
3154393,"13:26:21 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Would you be able to help me, please? or direct me to another libririan who is familiar with data analysis?"
3154393,13:28:38 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_7 : Thank you for your query. Please hold while I check if there is anyone who can assist you with STATA.
3154393,"13:29:17 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_7 : Hi PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5, was the library course about STATA?"
3154393,"13:29:55 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : The library course I attended was on data analysis with python. But I think this isn't a coding issue - it's a data analysis issue, so I thought maybe library could advice."
3154393,13:30:23 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : I think that time the course taught by PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2.
3154393,"13:32:07 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_7 : About the 1 and 0 markers you created, must you require them to be digit?"
3154393,13:32:18 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_7 : Could you do 'text'?
3154393,"13:35:47 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : if it's non-numerical, I think you cannot run the regression."
3154393,13:38:48 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : Hi amanda
3154393,13:39:23 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : I dont really have experience with stata for your question is more of a stats q
3154393,"13:39:42 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Hi PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4, how are you doing?"
3154393,"13:40:30 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Yups. I'm not sure what's wrong. I thought generally if you have missing values, you just create a new variable to have 1 if missing and 0 if not."
3154393,13:40:31 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : if your missing variable is highly correlated with other dependent variables due to colinearity
3154393,13:40:46 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : you have to use other methods to handle missing variables
3154393,13:41:05 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : or worse come to worse omit them totally
3154393,"13:41:31 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Hmm, two questions:"
3154393,13:41:41 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : other ways is to try to imput the average.. or to approximate the missing value
3154393,13:41:52 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : So how do I check if it is highly correlated?
3154393,13:42:00 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : What other methods should I consider?
3154393,13:42:02 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : depends on your software.
3154393,"13:42:41 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : For trying to find average, workclass is a string variable - cannot find average."
3154393,13:42:55 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : normally you would calculate something like vif.. a common collinearity measure
3154393,13:43:15 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : hmm. then yeah you might be out of luck
3154393,13:43:35 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : i think your dataset is such that the observations with missing values are all very alike
3154393,"13:43:48 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : So the thing is, my dataset got 16K observations. If I exclude 900+ observations, would that be bad?"
3154393,13:44:24 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : 5.6%
3154393,13:44:35 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : hmm.. feels a bit high
3154393,13:44:57 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : but i am not a statiscian
3154393,"13:45:05 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : I observe, a lot of the missing values are under workclass nad occupation both."
3154393,13:45:53 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : yeah.. there might be something systematic causing that
3154393,"13:46:16 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : off hand, i say if you cant get rid of colinearity the only choice is to omitt"
3154393,13:46:36 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : i am not sure about stata
3154393,13:46:47 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : but in other software you indicate missing values with a certain symbol
3154393,13:46:52 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : is thats the same in stat?
3154393,13:47:05 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : i dot usually create a new column to indicate missing
3154393,13:47:12 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : stata
3154393,"13:47:40 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : For stata, if it's string, then it's just blank. If it's numerical, then it's ."
3154393,"13:47:45 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : Stata represents a missing value as a very large number and<b>displays it as a dot (""."")</b>. You can use the dot in logical expression but you should use var &lt;= . ( not var == .) to make sure that the comparison is always correct."
3154393,13:47:58 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : ah okay string
3154393,13:48:08 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : just checking if you did it correctly..okay
3154393,"13:48:54 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Yeah. For mine, the missing values are all in the string variables. So nothing to do with the ."
3154393,"13:49:45 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Hmm, I'll give it some thought. Thanks for this."
3154393,13:50:02 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : assuming you did it correctly then it seems the only way is to omit.
3154393,13:50:10 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : what other ways did you see?
3154393,13:50:32 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Same as what you mention. about the imput and average.
3154393,"13:52:19 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : You know, another thought I had. What if I put a ""?"" into the blank. Then it will process workclass as private, federal government, local governmnet, state government, other, and ""?"""
3154393,13:52:29 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : is that true?
3154393,"13:52:55 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : do we know why the values are ""missing"""
3154393,13:53:13 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : It's just missing in the dataset. I guess people never answer the question or something.
3154393,13:53:45 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : then you shouldn't but a ?
3154393,13:54:03 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : then is assuming it is a valid value label
3154393,13:54:09 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : that
3154393,13:54:35 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : sorry i mean then you shouldnt put a ? as it is assuming it is a valid labe
3154393,"13:54:47 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : hmm, would distort the results, huh?"
3154393,"13:55:42 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : ok, thanks, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4. I'll go check online if 5% ommitted is ok. If can, then I just proceed that way."
3154393,"13:55:55 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Anyway, was meaning to reply to your email."
3154393,13:56:23 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : hope things going okay
3154393,"13:56:53 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Yeah, I think it's ok. Just need to work a bit faster."
3154393,13:56:55 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : So the systematic review part is ok. There are all together 50 articles for meta-analysis.
3154393,13:57:08 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : It's that the data cleaning takes very very very long.
3154393,"13:57:39 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : I got one month left, so I'm trying to work faster to meet my deadline."
3154393,"13:58:11 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : I think in terms of doing the analysis, I'm ok. More that if the data not all clean, hard to do a proper analysis."
3154393,13:58:12 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : ic.
3154393,13:58:16 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : then later still got to write the paper.
3154393,13:58:24 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : yes the data cleaning is important
3154393,13:59:00 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : PERSON_LASTNAME_6. I think it's also that my coding skills not so good la. So takes longer to do the data cleaning. Have to keep checking internet.
3154393,13:59:29 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : use chatgpt to help
3154393,13:59:31 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : But otherwise on track. I'm actually quite happy with the systematic review cause it pulled 50 articles.
3154393,13:59:35 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : gpt4 even i pay for it
3154393,13:59:52 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : PERSON_LASTNAME_3. I use chatgpt a lot for stata.
3154393,14:00:06 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : i see.. coding too is helpful<br /><br />
3154393,"14:00:33 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : PERSON_LASTNAME_1, the Lambregts and Schut article only got 37 articles pre 2018. After 2018, managed to add another 13. To make it an even 50. It's good - got 26 for probit analysis, and 24 for logit analysis."
3154393,"14:00:35 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : learning software, chatgpt is mostly a faster search"
3154393,14:01:02 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : coding i find it works for me though sometimes need to do a few prompts
3154393,14:01:14 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Yups. But chatgpt also sometimes can be wrong. So I try to double check if the results look whonky.
3154393,14:01:37 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : oh definitely thats why i like coding with it.. it is wrong it wont run :)
3154393,14:02:05 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : of course run still can be wrong..
3154393,14:02:18 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : how much you pay for the subscription ah?
3154393,14:02:41 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : actually i used to pay 20 usd to get chatgpt plus but i found a better method close to free
3154393,14:02:49 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Is it much better? I think the free version seems serviceable.
3154393,14:03:00 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : the reason you pay is to use GPT4 which is better than free chatgpt
3154393,14:03:07 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : i find it's like 20-40% better
3154393,14:03:13 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : hallunicates less
3154393,14:03:16 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : PERSON_LASTNAME_1? What close to free method?
3154393,14:03:25 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : you need to register at openai for the api
3154393,14:03:30 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : then use the playground
3154393,14:03:51 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : You pay for that?
3154393,14:04:29 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : it very very cheap
3154393,14:04:44 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : so far after months of use it charge me only 0.75
3154393,14:05:01 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Wow. I will go check it out.
3154393,14:05:50 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : its like 0.03 per 1000 tokens
3154393,"14:06:00 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Anyway, thanks, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4. I've got to go. But I'll keep you updated on the capstone."
3154393,14:06:20 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : i use it just for gpt4
3154393,14:06:49 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : My deadline is 30 June. Fingers crossed I can finish before then
3154393,14:06:57 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : im sure you can do it

3155999,13:31:27 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : I believe your thesis needs to be validated by the library before it is visible.
3155999,13:32:14 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : and we can only validate the records after PGR office share with us the finalized graduating name lists.

3155999,13:34:15 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_3 : We can't validate your thesis until we receive the list
3155999,"13:34:56 - PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : Yes, I understood. Do you know how to make my thesis be 'internally visible', so that my manager can check my thesis first?"
