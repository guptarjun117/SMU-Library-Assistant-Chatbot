May I ask help for that? thank you T-T\n15:49:03 - LIU QUAN : For example, \"only 30% of university students take jobs relevant to their bachelor's degrees within three years after graduation\" I can searched and obtained this information on website like Quora (without reliable source), I tried to find some essays or database but failed.\n15:49:05 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : Could you share more about your research and what kind of help you are seeking on?\n15:51:32 - LIU QUAN : I got idea to write the sentence above because I saw a similar research conducted in another country. but the data I can find is limited\n15:53:32 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : hmmm ok can give it a try... but usually starting with a (unreliable) argument and trying to look for evidence is harder.\n15:53:55 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : I might be a bit slow in replying you as I am having multiple chats. Please give me some time to get back to you.\n15:55:55 - LIU QUAN : No problem no hurry! I think the example above is the major challenge for now as I generate many ideas from that point. For other evidence I can alter the argument a bit I think......\n15:56:21 - LIU QUAN : Yes it is hard T-T generally I should read more before I write////\n15:57:06 - LIU QUAN : Thank you!\n15:57:09 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : so the information you're looking for is about whether university graduates are able to find jobs relevant to their degrees?\n15:57:36 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : or data related to unemployment rate will also be useful?\n15:59:41 - LIU QUAN : Yes, the concern is that many university students today did not consider carefully to choose the major, so that it is hard to apply their knowledge in future career\n16:00:29 - LIU QUAN : probably yes o.o\n16:02:40 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : I will take some time to work on this, and will get back to you via email ok?\n16:02:58 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : also btw, have you tried Chinese sources? That could be another option as well\n16:03:21 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : try if can find official statistics released by the government, i.e. primary sources\n16:08:36 - LIU QUAN : Sorry I was browsing other pages just now so that reply late. It is totally ok! Thanks for your support T-T\n16:11:45 - LIU QUAN : The Chinese sources (official statistics) is more about general topics and not that specific, I did not find the evidence there for now but I will continue to try! (I am kind of not good at researching......)\n16:21:19 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : yeah because your question is very specific, unlikely to be found in official released data\n16:21:25 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : i think might be better to search in chinese\n16:21:37 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : try keyword such as\n16:21:52 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : <a href=\"https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20210624A02AI800\">2021_ (qq.com)</a>\n16:22:06 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : <a href=\"https://new.qq.com/rain/a/20210624A013O900\">_ (qq.com)</a>\n16:24:06 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : some sources discuss whether jobs match their degree by disciplines\n16:25:40 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : <a href=\"https://www.edu.cn/zhong_guo_jiao_yu/jiao_yu_yan_jiu/zong_he/201410/t20141027_1194917.shtml\">- (www.edu.cn)</a>\n16:26:24 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : <p>this is research in 2010.. try to look for similar surveys conducted in more recent years, where possible 2010200967%57%</p><br />\n16:26:42 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : also try to make sure the source is reliable, this one seems ok (from edu.cn)\n16:27:17 - LIU QUAN : That's helpful!! thank you so much\n16:27:58 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : no problem! just try different keywords and sources. Sometimes the articles will also mention the source of their data, then you can dig deeper on those reports as well\n16:28:27 - LIU QUAN : PERSON_LASTNAME_5 I did not come up with the correct keyword and search like blindly......\n16:28:33 - LIU QUAN : Oki! Thank you\n16:28:50 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : no problem! let us know if you need further help\n16:29:06 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : we can refer you to a business librarian for a research consultation as well\n16:29:44 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : as you are search for sources, take note of the keywords they use. That is a strategy to help you expand and use relevant keywords\n16:33:04 - LIU QUAN : One more question! if it is not bothering could you help me verify a bit about the credibility of ranking from this website? <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/education-rankings-by-country;\" target=\"_blank\">https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/education-rankings-by-country;</a> I think it is not a fake website but I am not sure if it can be used for academic purpose. I also find another ranking from QS (which is more famous) but I do not really believe that from my personal perspective......\n16:33:17 - LIU QUAN : Oki :-D\n16:34:56 - LIU QUAN : <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/education-rankings-by-country\" target=\"_blank\">https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/education-rankings-by-country</a>\n16:35:19 - LIU QUAN : sorry, try this link if the first one is 404\n16:36:20 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : I think you can use this source\n16:36:27 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : like you said, it's not illegitimate\n16:36:39 - LIU QUAN : Oki! that's great\n16:36:39 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : but note that it is a commercial organization\n16:37:09 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : and whether or not their ranking is accurate or reputable/influential is another question\n16:37:40 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : QS rankings is more established and well known\n16:38:29 - LIU QUAN : T-T yea I think it is more like a summary from other sources rather than conducting researches and having reliable index to refer\n16:38:56 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : just need to exercise good judgement on which source you would like to use\n16:40:19 - LIU QUAN : <a href=\"https://www.qs.com/the-strongest-higher-education-systems-by-country-overview/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.qs.com/the-strongest-higher-education-systems-by-country-overview/</a> The QS ranking is here. But the higher education in mainland China is higher than Hong Kong......I do not really believe that (due to my personal impression), or did I miss something......?\n16:40:39 - LIU QUAN : quality of higher education*\n16:41:07 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : hmmm i can't comment on that lol. There will be some underlying methodlogies and justifications for their rankings, but those can of course be challenged\n16:41:35 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : but I would say that research is not about personal opinions\n16:42:23 - LIU QUAN : oki! thank you :-D your support is truly helpful\n16:42:23 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : you can present relevant sources and make your arguments, leaving it to your reader to judge\n16:42:36 - LIU QUAN : oki\n16:42:41 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : no prob! :)\n16:42:59 - PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : if you have no other questions, I will close the chat soon.\n16:43:10 - LIU QUAN : No problem.

On our library's end, we can purchase copies if your students require it, and that should be the only cost to us.\n16:33:03 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1 PERSON_LASTNAME_2 : Hope I managed to answer your question!\n16:33:49 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2 PERSON_LASTNAME_1 : Yes, thank you PERSON_FIRSTNAME_1.

I am searching for an academic article for goodwill and IFRS accounting\n12:50:46 - Valliappan : I am confused as to what is practitioner and what is an academic article\n12:51:56 - [name1] : Sure, what I can do is to help you identify what an academic article looks like. Before that may I find out further why you need to differentiate btw a practitioner and academic article\n12:53:54 - Valliappan : My team needs to find 1 practitioner and 1 academic article each. We have already found the practitioner one. Hence, We need to find an academic research article to summarise and write for our report.\n12:53:54 - [name1] : Here are some general differences btw some practitioner and academic article just FYI\n12:53:57 - [name1] : <p>In accounting, practitioner articles are typically written by professionals working in the field, such as practicing accountants or financial advisors, and are often focused on practical issues or solutions related to accounting and finance. These articles may provide practical advice, case studies, or real-world examples of how accounting principles are applied in practice.</p><p>Academic articles, on the other hand, are written by scholars or researchers and are often focused on theoretical or conceptual issues related to accounting and finance. These articles may include empirical studies, theoretical frameworks, or conceptual models that help to advance our understanding of accounting concepts and practices.</p><p>Some key differences between practitioner and academic articles in accounting may include:</p><ul><li>Focus: Practitioner articles are typically focused on practical issues or solutions related to accounting and finance, while academic articles may be more theoretical or conceptual in nature.</li><li>Tone: Practitioner articles may be written in a more informal or accessible style, while academic articles may be more technical or specialized.</li><li>Sources: Practitioner articles may draw on practical experience or case studies, while academic articles may rely more heavily on empirical research or theoretical frameworks.</li><li>Audience: Practitioner articles are typically written for a professional audience, such as practicing accountants or financial advisors, while academic articles are aimed at an academic audience, such as researchers or scholars in the field of accounting.</li></ul><br />\n12:54:07 - [name1] : ohh I see\n12:54:59 - [name1] : let me find some examples. Usually an academic article is published in something called academic journals, e.g. Journal of Accounting Research<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1475679X\" target=\"_blank\">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1475679X</a>\n12:55:49 - [name1] : articles in this journal are all academic articles. They often have a journal name, volume, issue and page number, and a lot of times a DOI\n12:55:56 - Valliappan : Now I understand the difference clearly, thank you! :)\n12:56:00 - [name1] : <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-679X.12480\" target=\"_blank\">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-679X.12480</a>\n12:56:07 - [name1] : this is one example academic accounting article\n12:56:57 - [name1] : no problem! let us know if you need any further help\n12:57:16 - Valliappan : Thanks for the articles.

 {"Chat ID":"3154393", "anon_transcript":"13:20:44 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_7 : Hi PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5, good day to you. Thank you for contacting SMU Libraries. My name is PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3. How may I help you today?\n13:21:37 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Hi PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3. I was hoping to get some advice on data analysis. I remember that previously I attended a data analysis course through the SMU library.\n13:22:56 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Using STATA. So basically, I'm trying to predict if an individual will earn &gt;50K. Since it's binary, I'm using a logit model, and the independent variables are things like age, workclass, occupation, country, etc.\n13:24:24 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : For workclass, occupation, country, there are 966, 963 and 273 missing variables respectively. I tried to create a new variable to indicate missing values. It'll indicate 1 if missing values, and 0 otherwise. But STATA keeps ommitting the 0.missing_values because of collinearity.\n13:25:08 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : I was hoping to speak to the data libririan to get some advice on my problem. I've checked the internet, and the advice online seems contradictory.\n13:26:21 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Would you be able to help me, please? or direct me to another libririan who is familiar with data analysis?\n13:28:38 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_7 : Thank you for your query. Please hold while I check if there is anyone who can assist you with STATA.\n13:29:17 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_7 : Hi PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5, was the library course about STATA?\n13:29:55 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : The library course I attended was on data analysis with python. But I think this isn't a coding issue - it's a data analysis issue, so I thought maybe library could advice.\n13:30:23 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : I think that time the course taught by PERSON_FIRSTNAME_2.\n13:32:07 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_7 : About the 1 and 0 markers you created, must you require them to be digit?\n13:32:18 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_3 PERSON_LASTNAME_7 : Could you do 'text'?\n13:35:47 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : if it's non-numerical, I think you cannot run the regression.\n13:38:48 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : Hi amanda\n13:39:23 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : I dont really have experience with stata for your question is more of a stats q\n13:39:42 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Hi PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4, how are you doing?\n13:40:30 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Yups. I'm not sure what's wrong. I thought generally if you have missing values, you just create a new variable to have 1 if missing and 0 if not.\n13:40:31 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : if your missing variable is highly correlated with other dependent variables due to colinearity\n13:40:46 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : you have to use other methods to handle missing variables\n13:41:05 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : or worse come to worse omit them totally\n13:41:31 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Hmm, two questions:\n13:41:41 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : other ways is to try to imput the average.. or to approximate the missing value\n13:41:52 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : So how do I check if it is highly correlated?\n13:42:00 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : What other methods should I consider?\n13:42:02 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : depends on your software.\n13:42:41 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : For trying to find average, workclass is a string variable - cannot find average.\n13:42:55 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : normally you would calculate something like vif.. a common collinearity measure\n13:43:15 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : hmm. then yeah you might be out of luck\n13:43:35 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : i think your dataset is such that the observations with missing values are all very alike\n13:43:48 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : So the thing is, my dataset got 16K observations. If I exclude 900+ observations, would that be bad?\n13:44:24 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : 5.6%\n13:44:35 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : hmm.. feels a bit high\n13:44:57 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : but i am not a statiscian\n13:45:05 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : I observe, a lot of the missing values are under workclass nad occupation both.\n13:45:53 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : yeah.. there might be something systematic causing that\n13:46:16 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : off hand, i say if you cant get rid of colinearity the only choice is to omitt\n13:46:36 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : i am not sure about stata\n13:46:47 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : but in other software you indicate missing values with a certain symbol\n13:46:52 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : is thats the same in stat?\n13:47:05 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : i dot usually create a new column to indicate missing\n13:47:12 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : stata\n13:47:40 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : For stata, if it's string, then it's just blank. If it's numerical, then it's .\n13:47:45 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : Stata represents a missing value as a very large number and<b>displays it as a dot (\".\")</b>. You can use the dot in logical expression but you should use var &lt;= . ( not var == .) to make sure that the comparison is always correct.\n13:47:58 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : ah okay string\n13:48:08 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : just checking if you did it correctly..okay\n13:48:54 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Yeah. For mine, the missing values are all in the string variables. So nothing to do with the .\n13:49:45 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Hmm, I'll give it some thought. Thanks for this.\n13:50:02 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : assuming you did it correctly then it seems the only way is to omit.\n13:50:10 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : what other ways did you see?\n13:50:32 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Same as what you mention. about the imput and average.\n13:52:19 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : You know, another thought I had. What if I put a \"?\" into the blank. Then it will process workclass as private, federal government, local governmnet, state government, other, and \"?\"\n13:52:29 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : is that true?\n13:52:55 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : do we know why the values are \"missing\"\n13:53:13 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : It's just missing in the dataset. I guess people never answer the question or something.\n13:53:45 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : then you shouldn't but a ?\n13:54:03 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : then is assuming it is a valid value label\n13:54:09 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : that\n13:54:35 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : sorry i mean then you shouldnt put a ? as it is assuming it is a valid labe\n13:54:47 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : hmm, would distort the results, huh?\n13:55:42 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : ok, thanks, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4. I'll go check online if 5% ommitted is ok. If can, then I just proceed that way.\n13:55:55 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Anyway, was meaning to reply to your email.\n13:56:23 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : hope things going okay\n13:56:53 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Yeah, I think it's ok. Just need to work a bit faster.\n13:56:55 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : So the systematic review part is ok. There are all together 50 articles for meta-analysis.\n13:57:08 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : It's that the data cleaning takes very very very long.\n13:57:39 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : I got one month left, so I'm trying to work faster to meet my deadline.\n13:58:11 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : I think in terms of doing the analysis, I'm ok. More that if the data not all clean, hard to do a proper analysis.\n13:58:12 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : ic.\n13:58:16 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : then later still got to write the paper.\n13:58:24 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : yes the data cleaning is important\n13:59:00 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : PERSON_LASTNAME_6. I think it's also that my coding skills not so good la. So takes longer to do the data cleaning. Have to keep checking internet.\n13:59:29 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : use chatgpt to help\n13:59:31 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : But otherwise on track. I'm actually quite happy with the systematic review cause it pulled 50 articles.\n13:59:35 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : gpt4 even i pay for it\n13:59:52 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : PERSON_LASTNAME_3. I use chatgpt a lot for stata.\n14:00:06 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : i see.. coding too is helpful<br /><br />\n14:00:33 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : PERSON_LASTNAME_1, the Lambregts and Schut article only got 37 articles pre 2018. After 2018, managed to add another 13. To make it an even 50. It's good - got 26 for probit analysis, and 24 for logit analysis.\n14:00:35 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : learning software, chatgpt is mostly a faster search\n14:01:02 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : coding i find it works for me though sometimes need to do a few prompts\n14:01:14 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Yups. But chatgpt also sometimes can be wrong. So I try to double check if the results look whonky.\n14:01:37 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : oh definitely thats why i like coding with it.. it is wrong it wont run :)\n14:02:05 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : of course run still can be wrong..\n14:02:18 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : how much you pay for the subscription ah?\n14:02:41 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : actually i used to pay 20 usd to get chatgpt plus but i found a better method close to free\n14:02:49 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Is it much better? I think the free version seems serviceable.\n14:03:00 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : the reason you pay is to use GPT4 which is better than free chatgpt\n14:03:07 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : i find it's like 20-40% better\n14:03:13 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : hallunicates less\n14:03:16 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : PERSON_LASTNAME_1? What close to free method?\n14:03:25 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : you need to register at openai for the api\n14:03:30 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : then use the playground\n14:03:51 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : You pay for that?\n14:04:29 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : it very very cheap\n14:04:44 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : so far after months of use it charge me only 0.75\n14:05:01 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Wow. I will go check it out.\n14:05:50 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : its like 0.03 per 1000 tokens\n14:06:00 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : Anyway, thanks, PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4. I've got to go. But I'll keep you updated on the capstone.\n14:06:20 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : i use it just for gpt4\n14:06:49 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : My deadline is 30 June. Fingers crossed I can finish before then\n14:06:57 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : im sure you can do it\n14:07:02 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_4 PERSON_LASTNAME_5 : good luck\n14:07:07 - PERSON_FIRSTNAME_5 : thanks thanks.
