If you are looking for something more advance, there are many commands (aka as operators) available in Factiva that can help you with\u00a0your complex search. You can refer to this \"Search Builder Cheat Sheet & Quick Reference Guide\" PDF <https://smu.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/teams/library/Datasets/Other%20misc%20files/Factiva%20-%20Search%20Builder%20Cheat%20Sheet%20%26%20Quick%20Reference%20Guide.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=6uXZVC> for help.\n\nBefore you start to use the commands, it is good to understand how Factiva indexs\u00a0each newspaper and their articles. Different papers use different way to index. There is no standard guide or cheat sheet for this; you have to go into each paper to find out.\n\n\n\nFrom the newspaper source, there is a \u201cDisplay Options\u201d on top right corner (see image below). Click on it and select \u201cHeadline, Lead Paragraph, plus Indexing\u201d. After that, you will be able to see a list of field labels. These labels will be useful when you do advance search.\n\nTake the following newspapers for example, The Straits Times. The field labels used for this article are \u201cCLM \u2013 Column\u201d, \u201cSE \u2013 Section\u201d, \u201cHD \u2013 Headline\u201d, etc. Depending on what is your requirement, you may find these field label useful: \u201cNS \u2013 Subject Code\u201d, \u201cRE \u2013 Region Code\u201d, and\u00a0 \u201cSN \u2013 Source Name\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n#1 With these field labels, you can search for articles that only (1) appeared on front page and (2) are related to Singapore, (3) from The Straits Times. These are the commands to enter in the search box: SE=ST front page and RE=singp and SN=The Straits Times. You have to use exactly the same field name that appeared on the article. If you have selected \"The Straits Times (Singapore)\" under Source, you can omit SN=The Straits Times.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n#2 Another example where you can search for (1) general news (2) in Singapore by using RE=singp and NS=gcat. If you have selected \"The Straits Times (Singapore)\" under Source, you can omit SN=The Straits Times.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou can also\u00a0exclude certain type of article in your search result. Please refer to this PDF \"How do I exclude certain types of articles\" <https://smu.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/teams/library/Datasets/Other%20misc%20files/Factiva%20-%20How%20do%20I%20exclude%20certain%20types%20of%20articles.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=qgbGCU> for more information on how it can be done."}]}

If you're working with a large amount of data, the resulting download file can be large and, therefore, slow to open and process.

Essentially, it\u2019s a standardized method that enables online software/services to communicate with each other by way of exchanging data.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAPIs are used in many ways, such as adding new data on a website through another (e.g. automatically tweet a new blog post), retrieving data from publicly open data repositories, or updating contents in another website. In research and academia, however, data retrieval is the most common usage of API. Generally, you will need some knowledge of programming (e.g. R or Python) to use API.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo illustrate, API is quite like the self-service kiosks that we sometimes see in cafes or restaurants:\u00a0\n-We use the self-service kiosk to send our order (request).\n-We also make payment and provide other details required by the kiosk (API key/authentication key).\u00a0\n-The restaurant processes our order and then pass it to us (response)."}]}
