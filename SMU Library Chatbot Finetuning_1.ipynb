Depending on the platform, you may need to apply for API Key or a developer account before you can use their API.

What's the benefit of using API over the database's web interface?-----------response-----------Sure, some databases have a web interface where you can specify your requirements and then download the data in excel, CSV, or other formats. However, these web interfaces often impose a download limit or may not provide the filters you needed (e.g. you want to specify a date range, but the interface doesn't offer this).

Generally, you will need some knowledge of programming (e.g. R or Python) to use API.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTo illustrate, API is quite like the self-service kiosks that we sometimes see in cafes or restaurants:\\xa0\\n-We use the self-service kiosk to send our order (request).\\n-We also make payment and provide other details required by the kiosk (API key/authentication key).\\xa0\\n-The restaurant processes our order and then pass it to us (response).\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0-----------, ', 'prompt-----------What are the data sources available in the library?-----------response-----------Check out this\\xa0Research Data Sources research guide <https://researchguides.smu.edu.sg/c.php?g=422027&p=2880526>.

The most reliable access is still through Library Website.\\nHere are the steps to create bookmarklet:\\n-Create a new bookmark in your browser and specify the location or URL to:\\njavascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://lti.library.smu.edu.sg/js/proxyga.js';})();\\nOr you can drag and drop this link to your bookmark menu : Proxify <javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://lti.library.smu.edu.sg/js/proxyga.js';})();>\\n-(optional) You can put this bookmark in your bookmark toolbar/menu-bar if you like\\n\\n-Go to one of your favourite journals, for example Location Science: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09668349. You will notice downloading of article is not free.\\n-Click on the new bookmark that you created at #1 (I call this bookmark “Proxify”). Login with SMU ID when prompted.\\n\\n-You are now verified (SMU Logo/Words shall appear) and can access the full article so long as Library has the subscription.-----------, \",

Do I have to claim every paper?-----------response-----------\"Claim\" is to indicate the paper is related to you (i.e. you are one of the authors). Ideally, IRIS should hide the Claim button if it detects the paper is yours or that you have already claimed it, but it is not able to differentiate. So, check your list of publications, you do not need to claim a paper if it already appears in the list of your publications.-----------, ', \"prompt-----------Must each publication record in IRIS be validated before being included in the CV?-----------response-----------If the publishing status for the record is 'forthcoming', no validation is needed before being included in the generated CV.\\xa0\\n\\nIf the publishing status is 'published' 'advance online' or 'presented', validation is needed to be included in the CV.\\xa0\\n\\nOther publishing status will not be included in the generated CV.
